# ionic-angular-pdc
example of Ionic angular 14 standalone components directives and pipes - no modules.

"@ionic/angular": "6.1.7-dev.11654279011.1b971e3e"

Heads up that standalone components used with routing will not be compatible with Ionic until this feature is completed: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/25404. We are still gathering feedback and interest from the community.
